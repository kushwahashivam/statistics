# Continuous Probability Distribution
In case of continuous distribution, the probability of any discrete value is 0 (near zero). And the probability of their interval is defined. 
For example, in a 360 degree pendulum, the probability of pendulum being at a specific angle at any time is zero and probability of being in a range is perfectly defined.
## Density
(Probability for Continuous Spaces)
The equation used to describe a continuous probability distribution is called a probability density function. 
Heuristically, the probability density function is just the distribution from which a continuous random variable is drawn, like the normal distribution, which is the PDF of a normally distributed continuous random variable.

> The probability that a random variable X takes a value in the (open or closed) interval [a, b] is given by the integral of a function called **probability density function** f(x):
> $$
P(a <= X <= b) = \int_a^b f(x)dx.
$$
If the random variable can be any real number, the probability density function is normalized so that:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)dx = 1
$$

Density function can also be non uniform.
Density is the y-axis value of function. Density can be smaller than or equal to or larger than one.
