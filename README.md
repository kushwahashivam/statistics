## Interpolation
Use neighboring values to find the missing value in a distribution.
## Scatter Plot
Plotting each data point uniquely.
Draw a scatter plot with possibility of several semantic groupings.
`sns.scatterplot(x, y)`
## Bar Plot 
Show point estimates and confidence intervals as rectangular bars.
Generally used when data is too big to understand from scatter plot.
`sns.barplot(x, y)`
## Histogram 
Flexibly plot a univariate distribution of observations.
Used for frequency measurement of data points ( mainly 1D data ).
`sns.distplot(x)`
