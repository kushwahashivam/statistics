# Continuous Probability Distribution
In case of continuous distribution, the probability of any discrete value is 0 (near zero). And the probability of their interval is defined. 
For example, in a 360 degree pendulum, the probability of pendulum being at a specific angle at any time is zero and probability of being in a range is perfectly defined.
## Density
(Probability for Continuous Spaces)
The equation used to describe a continuous probability distribution is called a probability density function. 
Heuristically, the probability density function is just the distribution from which a continuous random variable is drawn, like the normal distribution, which is the PDF of a normally distributed continuous random variable.

> The probability that a random variable X takes a value in the (open or closed) interval [a, b] is given by the integral of a function called **probability density function**
