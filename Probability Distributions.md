# Continuous Probability Distribution
In case of continuous distribution, the probability of any discrete value is 0 (near zero). And the probability of their interval is defined. 
For example, in a 360 degree pendulum, the probability of pendulum being at a specific angle at any time is zero and probability of being in a range is perfectly defined.
